//  fill in the blanks to log the commented values
// and don't just write the correct answer directly!
//  you should use firstFiveLetters to fill in one blank for each step

firstFiveLetters = 'b' + firstFiveLetters;
console.log(firstFiveLetters); // should log "bc"

firstFiveLetters = firstFiveLetters + 'd';

firstFiveLetters = 'a' + firstFiveLetters;
console.log(firstFiveLetters); // should log "abcd"

  your challenge is to decide whether to use let or to use const
  - use let if
    the variable is declared without an assignment
    or the variable is ever reassigned later in the script
  - use const if
    the variable is declared with a value and never reassigned
